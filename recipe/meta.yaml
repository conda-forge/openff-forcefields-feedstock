  summary: Force fields released by the Open Force Field Initiative.
  description: |
    The provided OFFXML (force field) files are successive versions
    of a general-purpose small molecule force field, written in the
    SMIRNOFF format; this force field should cover all or almost all
    of drug-like chemical space, and illustrate some of the major
    functionality of the SMIRNOFF format as well as how it simplifies
    the specification of force field parameters in a compact and
    chemically sensible way.
